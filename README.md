# Get To Know Me !
**౨ৎ  I  go  by  any  pronouns  except  for  She/Her.**
- If  you  want  some  specific  ones  ,  you  can  use  It / Xe / They / He  ,  from  most  to  least  preferred.

**I am Transgender (FtM) , Androsexual , and Polyamorous, and Otherkin. ౨ৎ**
- Transgender ; A person whose gender identity, gender expression or behavior does not conform to that typically associated with the sex to which they were assigned at birth
- Androsexual ; Attracted to men, males, or those who identify on the masculine spectrum, regardless of whether they are assigned male at birth.
- Polyamorous ; A person who can have open intimate or romantic relationships with more than one person at a time.
- Otherkin ; A person who identifies as non-human, typically as being wholly or partially an animal or mythical being
  - I would prefer if you refer to me as a cake roll, since that's my technical species! I don't like being human, it's gross.

**౨ৎ I have undiagnosed Autism, ADHD, and BPD.**
- I can get distracted a lot! If you need to catch my attention, whisper me a message and I'll very likely see it.
- Sometimes I'm not entirely in the mood to talk because of going non-verbal (usually semi-verbal.) My name will state if this is happening, though, so it won't be hard to notice.
- BPD is a questionable thing for me, and I am still trying to figure out whether I have it or not, so it may not be entirely true.

# Before You Interact !
**I  am  a  Cosmo  selfhood  ,  and  I  do  not  interact  with  doubles  unless  you  are  a  close  friend.  ౨ৎ**
- This may change if I am not in any of my Cosmo skins, but if I am, then I'm probably not comfortable.

**౨ৎ I love talking with people! Please do not be afraid to talk to me. Sometimes I am picky on who I interact with, though.**
- I am not open to C+H with strangers unless my name specifies otherwise.

**Something that I want to mention is that I can sometimes seem upset, or that I'm angry at you. I promise that I'm not! My tone can sometimes come off as aggressive when I'm really trying not to be, It's just the way I speak, and I do it unintentionally. ౨ৎ**

**౨ৎ I LOVE to talk about my interests! I talk a lot if it even interests me in the slightest. I might start talking about stuff a little too much, if this bothers you, tell me to shorten it down a little!**
